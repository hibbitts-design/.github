# Open Source Software to Empower Digitally Curious Open Educators and Publishers

**Hello there, fellow digital enthusiasts üëãüèº**  

Welcome to HibbittsDesign.org, where a systems-oriented approach to open [source] software is combined with a focus on the user experience of both authors and students.

## What‚Äôs happening these days?
üíª **Current Projects:**  

- [Docsify Open Course Starter Kit](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-course-starter-kit) for course authors and facilitators
- [Docsify Open MultiCourse Starter Kit](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-multicourse-starter-kit) for course authors and facilitators
- [Docsify Open Publishing Starter Kit](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit) for open educators, OER publishers, and students
- [Docsify-This.net](http://docsify-this.net/) project, along with the [Publishing with Docsify-This](https://docsify-this.net/?basePath=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hibbitts-design/publishing-with-docsify-this/main&sidebar=true&edit-link=https://github.com/hibbitts-design/publishing-with-docsify-this/blob/main/README.md&maxLevel=4) guide, provides a quick way to render remote Markdown files without your own instance of Docsify

üõ† **Grav CMS Projects (actively maintained):**  

- [Grav Open Course Hub Skeleton](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-course-hub)
- [Grav Open MultiCourse Hub Skeleton](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-multicourse-hub)
- [Grav Open Publishing Space Skeleton](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-open-publishing-space)
- [Grav Learn2 with GitSync Skeleton](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-learn2-with-git-sync)

üõü **Online Course Design:**  

To help teams and individual educators create better online experiences for their students, the [Canvas LMS site](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/69678) for my most recent highly successful offering of SFU CMPT-363 User Interface Design (which was redesigned as an online and more scalable variation of the traditional 3rd-year face-to-face course) remains public. The source content for this course, along with the previous two offerings, is also available at the [CMPT-363 Hub Standalone site](https://paulhibbitts.github.io/cmpt-363) built with the [Docsify Open MultiCourse Starter Kit](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-multicourse-starter-kit).

üí∞ **Open Source Contributions:**  

I also support several related open-source projects, including [Mastodon](https://www.patreon.com/mastodon), [Docsify](https://opencollective.com/docsify), [Docsify-Themeable](https://github.com/sponsors/jhildenbiddle) and [Grav CMS](https://opencollective.com/grav).

‚òïÔ∏è **Informational Meetups:**  

As someone who has benefited from informational interviews very early in his career, I welcome similar requests for coffee meetups in #YVR when my extensive experience in higher education instruction, the craft of interaction design and professional consulting practices can be of value.

üíº **Guest Lectures:**  

Are you teaching a UX, Web/Software design or publishing course in Vancouver/Burnaby/Surrey? I am offering [several possible guest lecture/discussion topics for local in-person classes](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/paulhibbitts_are-you-teaching-a-ux-websoftware-design-activity-7097259423617712129-AtVi) based on my open source experiences.

üå± **Always learning, always designing, always building**

## Services provided
To help increase adoption and help fund my open source work, I offer professional services related to my [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) and [Grav CMS](https://getgrav.org/) projects to help open educators and publishers leverage Markdown software and workflows more effectively.
