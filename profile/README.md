<h1>OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE TO EMPOWER DIGITALLY CURIOUS OPEN EDUCATORS AND PUBLISHERS</h1>

<span style="font-size:24px;">Well, hello there 👋🏼</span>

Welcome to HibbittsDesign.org, where a systems-oriented approach to open [source] software for tech-savvy or curious educators and publishers is combined with a focus on the user experience of both authors and students.

## What‘s happening these days?
- 💻 Working on several open education and publishing projects, including:
  - [Docsify Open Course Starter Kit](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-course-starter-kit) for course authors and facilitators
  - [Docsify Open Publishing Starter Kit](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit) for open educators, OER publishers, and students
  - In addition to the standard Docsify Starter Kits, several pre-configured templates are also now available:
    -  [Docsify Open Publishing Starter Kit One Page](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit-one-page)
    -  [Docsify Open Course Starter Kit One Page](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-course-starter-kit-one-page)
  - Based on the Docsify Open Publishing Starter Kit, my recent [Docsify-This.net](http://docsify-this.net/) project along with the [Publishing with Docsify-This](https://docsify-this.net/?basePath=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hibbitts-design/publishing-with-docsify-this/main&sidebar=true&edit-link=https://github.com/hibbitts-design/publishing-with-docsify-this/blob/main/README.md&maxLevel=4) guide provides a quick way to render remote Markdown files without your own instance of Docsify
- 🛠 Updating my [Grav Skeleton projects](https://getgrav.org/downloads/skeletons) ([Open Course Hub](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-course-hub), [Open MultiCourse Hub](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-multicourse-hub), [Open Publishing Space](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-open-publishing-space), and [Learn2 with GitSync](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-learn2-with-git-sync)) with the latest notable [Grav CMS](https://getgrav.org/) system, theme and plugin releases.
- 🛟 Helping teams and individual educators create better online experiences for their students
- 👨🏼‍🏫 Wrapped up teaching six successive offerings of SFU CMPT-363 User Interface Design ([Canvas LMS site](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/69678) | [Standalone site](https://paulhibbitts.github.io/cmpt-363)), which was re-designed as an online and more scalable variation of the traditional 3rd-year face-to-face course.
- 💰 Supporting other related open-source projects, including [Mastodon](https://www.patreon.com/mastodon), [Docsify](https://opencollective.com/docsify), [Docsify-Themeable](https://github.com/sponsors/jhildenbiddle) and [Grav CMS](https://opencollective.com/grav).
- ☕️ As someone who has benefited from informational interviews very early in his career, Paul welcomes similar requests for coffee meetups in #YVR when his extensive experience in higher education instruction, the craft of interaction design and professional consulting practices can be of value
- 💼 Are you teaching a UX, Web/Software design or publishing course in Vancouver/Burnaby/Surrey? I am offering [several possible guest lecture/discussion topics for local in-person classes](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/paulhibbitts_are-you-teaching-a-ux-websoftware-design-activity-7097259423617712129-AtVi) based on my open source experiences.
- 🌱 Always learning, always designing, always building
