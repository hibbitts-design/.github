# Open Source Software to Empower Digitally Curious Open Educators and Publishers

**Hello there, fellow digital enthusiasts üëãüèº**  

Welcome to HibbittsDesign.org, where a systems-oriented approach to open [source] software is combined with a focus on the user experience of both authors and students.

üíª **Current Projects:**  

- [Docsify Open Course Starter Kit](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-course-starter-kit) for course authors and facilitators
- [Docsify Open Publishing Starter Kit](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit) for open educators, OER publishers, and students
- [Docsify-This.net](http://docsify-this.net/) project, along with the [Publishing with Docsify-This](https://docsify-this.net/?basePath=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hibbitts-design/publishing-with-docsify-this/main&sidebar=true&edit-link=https://github.com/hibbitts-design/publishing-with-docsify-this/blob/main/README.md&maxLevel=4) guide, provides a quick way to render remote Markdown files without your own instance of Docsify

üõ† **Grav CMS Skeletons:**  

- [Open Course Hub](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-course-hub)
- [Open MultiCourse Hub](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-multicourse-hub)
- [Open Publishing Space](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-open-publishing-space)
- [Learn2 with GitSync](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-learn2-with-git-sync)

üõü **Online Course Designs:**  

With the aim to help teams and individual educators create better online experiences for their students, the [Canvas LMS site](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/69678) for my most recent highly successful offering of SFU CMPT-363 User Interface Design (which was re-designed as an online and more scalable variation of the traditional 3rd-year face-to-face course) will remain public. The source content for this course, along with the previous two offerings, is also available at the [CMPT-363 Hub Standalone site](https://paulhibbitts.github.io/cmpt-363) .

üí∞ **Open Source Contributions:**  

I also support several related open-source projects, including [Mastodon](https://www.patreon.com/mastodon), [Docsify](https://opencollective.com/docsify), [Docsify-Themeable](https://github.com/sponsors/jhildenbiddle) and [Grav CMS](https://opencollective.com/grav).

‚òïÔ∏è **Informational Meetups:**  

As someone who has benefited from informational interviews very early in his career, I welcome similar requests for coffee meetups in #YVR when my extensive experience in higher education instruction, the craft of interaction design and professional consulting practices can be of value.

üíº **Guest Lectures:**  

Are you teaching a UX, Web/Software design or publishing course in Vancouver/Burnaby/Surrey? I am offering [several possible guest lecture/discussion topics for local in-person classes](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/paulhibbitts_are-you-teaching-a-ux-websoftware-design-activity-7097259423617712129-AtVi) based on my open source experiences.

üå± **Always learning, always designing, always building**
