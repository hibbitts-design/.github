# Well, hello there 👋🏼

Welcome to Hibbitts Design, where a systems-first approach to open [source] software for tech curious educators and publishers is combined with a focus on the user experience of both authors and students.

## What‘s happening these days?
- 💻 Working on several open education and publishing projects, including:
  - [Docsify Open Course Starter Kit](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-course-starter-kit) for course facilitators
  - [Docsify Open Publishing Starter Kit](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit) for open educators, OER publishers, and students
  - In addition to the standard Docsify Starter Kits, several pre-configured templates are also now available:
    -  [Docsify Open Publishing Starter Kit One Page](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit-one-page)
    -  [Docsify Open Course Starter Kit One Page](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-course-starter-kit-one-page)
    -  [Docsify Open Publishing Starter Kit Remote](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit-remote)
  - Based on the [Docsify Open Publishing Starter Kit Remote](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit-remote), [docsify-this.net](http://docsify-this.net/) provides a quick way to render a [remote Markdown file](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit/blob/main/README.md) without your own instance of Docsify, as a [standalone page](https://docsify-this.net/?basePath=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit/main/) with an [optional table of contents](https://docsify-this.net/?basePath=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit/main/&toc=true)
- 🛟 Helping teams and individual educators create better online experiences for their students
