# Well, hello there 👋🏼

Welcome to Hibbitts Design, where a systems-first approach to open [source] software for tech curious educators and publishers is combined with a focus on the user experience of both authors and students.

## What‘s happening these days?
- 💻 Working on several open education and publishing projects, including:
  - [Docsify Open Course Starter Kit](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-course-starter-kit) for course facilitators
  - [Docsify Open Publishing Starter Kit](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit) for open educators, OER publishers, and students
  - In addition to the standard Docsify Starter Kits, several pre-configured templates are also now available:
    -  [Docsify Open Publishing Starter Kit One Page](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit-one-page)
    -  [Docsify Open Course Starter Kit One Page](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-course-starter-kit-one-page)
  - Based on the Docsify Open Publishing Starter Kit, my new [Docsify-This.net](http://docsify-this.net/) project along with the [Publishing with Docsify-This](https://docsify-this.net/?basePath=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hibbitts-design/publishing-with-docsify-this/main&sidebar=true&edit-link=https://github.com/hibbitts-design/publishing-with-docsify-this/blob/main/README.md&maxLevel=4) guide provides a quick way to render remote Markdown files without your own instance of Docsify
- 🛠 Updating my [Grav Skeleton projects](https://getgrav.org/downloads/skeletons) ([Open Course Hub](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-course-hub), [Open MultiCourse Hub](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-multicourse-hub), [Open Publishing Space](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-open-publishing-space), and [Learn2 with GitSync](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-learn2-with-git-sync)) with the latest notable [Grav CMS](https://getgrav.org/) system, theme and plugin releases.
- 🛟 Helping teams and individual educators create better online experiences for their students
- 👨🏼‍🏫 Recently wrapped up teaching six successive offerings of SFU [CMPT-363 User Interface Design](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/69678), which was re-designed as an online variation of the traditional 3rd-year face-to-face course.
- 🌱 Always learning, always designing, always building
