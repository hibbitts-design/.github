<h1>Open-Source Software to Empower Digitally Curious Open Creators, Publishers and&nbsp;Educators</h1> 

### Hello there, fellow digital enthusiasts üëãüèº

Welcome to HibbittsDesign.org, where a systems-oriented approach to open [source] software is combined with a focus on the user experience of both authors and their readers.

## What‚Äôs happening these days?
### üíª Docsify Projects (docsify.js.org)
A documentation-style platform for Markdown publishing that requires no Web server, making it accessible to a broader audience.

#### Docsify Web App
- [Docsify-This.net](http://docsify-this.net/) for open publishers, educators, and those seeking a simple way to share publicly accessible Markdown content

#### Docsify Starter Kits
- [Docsify Open Course Starter Kit](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-course-starter-kit) for course authors and facilitators
- [Docsify Open MultiCourse Starter Kit](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-multicourse-starter-kit) for course authors and facilitators
- [Docsify Open Publishing Starter Kit](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit) for open publishers and digital content creators 

### üõ† Grav CMS Projects (getgrav.org)
A highly customizable Markdown publishing platform, powered by the versatile Twig template language.

- [Grav Open Course Hub Skeleton](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-course-hub)
- [Grav Open MultiCourse Hub Skeleton](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-multicourse-hub)
- [Grav Open Publishing Space Skeleton](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-open-publishing-space)
- [Grav Learn2 with GitSync Skeleton](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-learn2-with-git-sync)

### üõü Online Course Design

To help teams and individual educators create better online experiences for their students, the [Canvas LMS site](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/69678) for my most recent highly successful offering of SFU CMPT-363 User Interface Design (which was redesigned as an online and more scalable variation of the traditional 3rd-year face-to-face course) remains public. The source content for this course, along with the previous two offerings, is also available at the [CMPT-363 Hub Standalone site](https://paulhibbitts.github.io/cmpt-363) built with the [Docsify Open MultiCourse Starter Kit](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-multicourse-starter-kit).

### üôèüèº Open Source Contributions

I also support several related open-source projects, including [Mastodon](https://www.patreon.com/mastodon), [Docsify](https://opencollective.com/docsify), [Docsify-Themeable](https://github.com/sponsors/jhildenbiddle) and [Grav CMS](https://opencollective.com/grav).

### ‚òïÔ∏è Informational Meetups

As someone who has benefited from informational interviews very early in his career, I welcome similar requests for coffee meetups in #YVR when my extensive experience in higher education instruction, the craft of interaction design and professional consulting practices can be of value.

### üíº Guest Lectures

Are you teaching a UX, Web/Software design or publishing course in Vancouver/Burnaby/Surrey? I am offering [several possible guest lecture/discussion topics for local in-person classes](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/paulhibbitts_are-you-teaching-a-ux-websoftware-design-activity-7097259423617712129-AtVi) based on my open source experiences.
