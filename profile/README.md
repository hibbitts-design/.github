<h1>Open-Source Software to Empower Digitally Curious Open Publishers, Educators, and&nbsp;Creators</h1> 

### Hello there, fellow digital enthusiasts üëãüèº

Welcome to HibbittsDesign.org ‚Äì where over two decades of experience in software interaction design, UX consulting, and higher education converge to shape a systems-oriented approach to open-source software.

The source content for this course, along with the previous two offerings, is also available at the [CMPT-363 Hub Standalone site](https://paulhibbitts.github.io/cmpt-363) built with the [Docsify Open MultiCourse Starter Kit](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-multicourse-starter-kit).

### üôèüèº Open Source Contributions

I also support several related open-source projects, including [Mastodon](https://www.patreon.com/mastodon), [Docsify](https://opencollective.com/docsify), [Docsify-Themeable](https://github.com/sponsors/jhildenbiddle) and [Grav CMS](https://opencollective.com/grav).

### ‚òïÔ∏è Informational Meetups

As someone who has benefited from informational interviews very early in his career, I welcome similar requests for coffee meetups in #YVR when my extensive experience in higher education instruction, the craft of interaction design and professional consulting practices can be of value.

### üíº Guest Lectures
